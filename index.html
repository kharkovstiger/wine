    <div class="history Italy">
        <p>Favorable natural conditions of the peninsula contributed to the cultivation of grapes and winemaking since
            ancient times. The ancient Greeks south-eastern part of the peninsula was called Enotria , what was done,
            according to some assumptions, the Greek οἶνος , « wine ", as the country was rich in vineyards . Due to
            the active Greek colonization of the peninsula the ancient wine-making technologies were perceived peoples
            who inhabited Italy, including the Etruscans.</p>
        <p>With the rise of the Roman Empire, wine production received a new round of development. The Romans made
            improvements in the cultivation of vines and technology have developed new methods of wine production.
            With the conquest of the Romans the cultivation of grapes spread around the Mediterranean and other regions
            of Europe and contributed to the development of local winemaking. With the fall of Rome winemaking
            tradition gradually lost and begin to revive only in the XI century, in a period of rapid economic recovery
            and strengthening of trade relations of the Italian State. In the second half of the XV century Italian
            wine again begins to decline. Among the reasons are called the Ottoman conquest in Europe, the destruction
            of traditional trade relations, the discovery of America and the transfer of the most important commercial
            centers in Europe on the Atlantic coast, as well as the political fragmentation of Italy and numerous
            internal armed conflicts. In the late Middle Ages and in modern times were engaged in wine production
            monastery and small farms, for their own use and sale within the country.</p>
        <p>By the middle of the XX century in Italy, along with a wide variety of cultivated grapes, preserved outdated
            methods of work in the vineyards and wine production technology. Only in 1960, thanks to the clearance
            at the legislative level regulatory system that guarantees the authenticity and originality of the produced
            wines ( appellations ), and tightening control over the quality of products, wine-making gets a new impetus
            to its development. In addition, the production introducing new technologies and the latest research.</p>
        <p>Until the mid -1990s Italy held first place in the volume of world wine production. By the beginning of the
            XXI century Italy ceded primacy winemakers of France. According to a study conducted by the International
            Wine and Wine Organization (OIV), as of 2006 Italy among the world's producers was in second place with a
            volume of 520.36 million in. Dal.</p></div>
